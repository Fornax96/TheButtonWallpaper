Changes your desktop background to The Button timer.

This program was written in about half an hour and will not further be updated.

It currently only works on Xfce (Xubuntu) environments, but it should be easy enough to port to others.
You'll need to edit WallpaperManager.java and add your own background changing script.

Edit the start.sh script before running!
